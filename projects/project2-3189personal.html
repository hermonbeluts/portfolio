        <h1>Survey Research Analysis</h1>
        <p>Exploring American Attitudes on AI in Education | Fall 2024</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project, conducted as part of a Cornell University course, involved creating and fielding a nationally 
            representative survey with over 3,000 US adults in partnership with Verasight. The survey gauged attitudes 
            on topics such as politics, social media, and the environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            Key steps included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question Design:</strong> Drafted and refined survey questions, focusing on factors like wording, answer options, and randomization.</li>
            <li><strong>IRB Training:</strong> Completed certification to conduct human research ethically.</li>
            <li><strong>Survey Deployment:</strong> Sent the survey to a representative sample of 3,016 US adults from October 21–November 5, 2024.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Analyzed responses in R, applying survey weights and recoding answer options for easier interpretation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal Contribution</h2>
        <p>
            My research focused on attitudes toward AI in education, with the question: “How useful do you believe artificial 
            intelligence (AI) is as a tool in classrooms?” After collecting responses, I:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recoded responses into three categories: “Not Useful,” “Neutral,” and “Useful.”</li>
            <li>Calculated weighted percentages, finding that 39.1% of Americans found AI not useful, 33.1% were neutral, and 27.8% found it useful.</li>
            <li>Analyzed regional differences, revealing higher skepticism in the West (42.7% “Not Useful”) and more optimism in the Northeast (30% “Useful”).</li>
            <li>Cross-tabulated my question with a similar one in the survey and ran a chi-square test, confirming response validity (p-value < 2.2e-16).</li>
            <li>Drafted an op-ed to contextualize the findings and explore their implications for the future of AI in education.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Public skepticism toward AI in education is significant, with most respondents finding it “Not Useful.”</li>
            <li>Regional differences suggest cultural or technological divides influence attitudes toward AI.</li>
            <li>Chi-square analysis confirmed that question phrasing did not significantly alter responses, validating the data’s reliability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Survey design and deployment with a nationally representative sample.</li>
            <li>Data analysis and visualization using R and RStudio.</li>
            <li>Statistical testing and interpretation, including chi-square analysis.</li>
            <li>Written communication through op-ed writing and presenting findings.</li>
        </ul>
