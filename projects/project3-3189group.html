        <h1>Survey Research on AI</h1>
        <p>Analyzing public trust in AI across various sectors based on demographics.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            As part of a group project in a Cornell University course, we conducted a survey analysis to explore how 
            demographic differences influence trust in AI across four sectors: politics, healthcare, advertising, and education. 
            Our research was based on responses to four targeted survey questions.
        </p>

        <h2>Research Process</h2>
        <p>
            Key steps included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Research Design:</strong> Developed the research question: 
                “How do differences in demographics influence trust in AI across various sectors?”</li>
            <li><strong>Survey Data Selection:</strong> Selected four survey questions addressing AI trust in politics, healthcare, advertising, and education.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Applied survey weights, recoded answer categories, and performed chi-squared tests against demographic variables.</li>
            <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Created barplots to highlight significant differences by education level.</li>
            <li><strong>Poster Presentation:</strong> Synthesized findings and presented insights in a comprehensive poster.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Education is a statistically significant factor influencing trust in AI for healthcare, advertising, and education, but not for politics.</li>
            <li>People without a college education are more skeptical of AI in education, likely due to familiarity differences.</li>
            <li>Concerns about AI in healthcare center around accuracy and privacy, consistent across education levels.</li>
            <li>Trust in AI for vote-count verification may be more influenced by political affiliation than education.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal Contribution</h2>
        <p>
            I contributed to drafting the research question, conducting data analysis, and creating visualizations to support 
            our findings.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Survey data analysis and visualization using R and RStudio.</li>
            <li>Statistical testing with chi-squared analysis.</li>
            <li>Collaborative research and presentation skills through poster creation.</li>
        </ul>
