            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
                There is an annual apple festival in my college town. As part of a programming course, we were tasked with designing a website for the festival that year. 
                The goal was to synthesize and consolidate information to make it as easily accessible as possible.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                Initially, I searched the web for various sources of information on the details of the festival, such as timing, location, types of vendors, and performers. 
                Using this information, I built, stylized, and created interactive elements for the website from scratch. I went through several iterations of page layout and design to create a user-friendly output.
